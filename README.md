# library-c
Library system in c, without using an external file for storage.
This was a project I made in my third semester, I got this idea from the internet and there were many examples, but I wanted to make it on my own because the examples I found were using features and functions I have not studied yet like using file. This was my first project in my electrical engineering degree so forgive me if this looks very amateur, but I tried my best.
